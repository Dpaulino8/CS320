Software Test Automation and QA

How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
Implement thorough testing strategies, including unit testing, integration testing, and system testing, to verify the functionality of your code across different levels of abstraction. Additionally, perform security testing, such as penetration testing and vulnerability assessments, to identify and address potential security vulnerabilities.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
Engage with stakeholders, including end-users, to gather and document their requirements, preferences, and expectations for the software. Use techniques such as interviews, surveys, and user stories to elicit comprehensive requirements.

How do I approach designing software?
Requirements Analysis: Understand and document the functional and non-functional requirements of the software, including user needs, system constraints, and business objectives.
